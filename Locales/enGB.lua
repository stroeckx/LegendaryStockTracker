L["FAQ_Stock_Title"] = "Tracking your stock"

L["FAQ_Profit_Title"] = "Calculating profit margins"
L["FAQ_Profit_Description"] = "If you have TSM installed, LST can also show you a profit margin on each item, depending on which price source you use:\n\n1. LST crafting cost\nWhen opening your professions, LST will scan all recipes you have unlocked, and remember which items you can make, and which materials are required for each item at each rank.\nLST will then calculate an accurate crafting cost using your TSM material price for each of the materials.\nAuction house cut is then taken into account from the dbmarket price to show you how much profit you would make on each item. If there is no dbmarket price available, LST will fall back on your tsm auctioning operation's normal price.\nLST won't be able to read the data of ranks you haven't unlocked yet if you have never crafted any rank 1's of the item. You will need to craft at least one rank 1 of each item before LST can scan all other rank's recipes.\n\n2. TSM operation prices:\nWhen using tsm operations as crafting source, your auctioning operation's minimum price is seen as the crafting cost of each item, so it is important to have an accurate minimum price set up in your operations for each item at each rank. \nSince the auction house cut should already be included in your min price, it is not taken into account anymore afterwards, which means the raw profit will actually be 5% less as shown by LST, this 5% is only on the profit part of a sale though, since the fee is already included in the minimum price. If there is no dbmarket price available, LST will fall back on your tsm auctioning operation's normal price."
