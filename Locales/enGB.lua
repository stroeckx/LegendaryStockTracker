LST crafting cost\nWhen opening your professions, LST will scan all recipes you have unlocked, and remember which items you can make, and which materials are required for each item at each rank.\nLST will then calculate an accurate crafting cost using your TSM material price for each of the materials.\nAuction house cut is then taken into account from the dbmarket price to show you how much profit you would make on each item. If there is no dbmarket price available, LST will fall back on your tsm auctioning operation's normal price.\nLST won't be able to read the data of ranks you haven't unlocked yet if you have never crafted any rank 1's of the item. You will need to craft at least one rank 1 of each item before LST can scan all other rank's recipes.\n\n"
